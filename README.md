# 👋 Hi, I’m Eren Cice

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am an **Econometrics student** with a strong interest in **statistics** and **mathematical statistics**, aiming to apply theoretical knowledge in practical data science and machine learning projects. I work primarily with **Python** and **R**, using libraries like **Pandas**, **Scikit-Learn**, **ggplot2**, and **caret** to analyze data and build predictive models.

My goal is to bridge the gap between rigorous mathematical and econometric theory and real-world applications, extracting actionable insights through advanced statistical techniques and machine learning methods. 📊
